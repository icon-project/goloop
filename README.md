Official Blockchain Architecture Implementation of the ICON 2.0 Protocol.

Welcome to the Goloop github repository. Goloop is a smart contract enabled enterprise-grade blockchain software written in Go with many unique features providing a secure, immutable and scalable environment to develop decentralized applications.

This github repository contains the source code of the Goloop software, which will serve as base modules for enterprise blockchains as well as the implementation base for ICON 2.0 protocol.

## Contribution Guidelines

There are two branches in the repository. "master" is the development branch for ICON 2.0 and the "base" is the branch shared with enterprises and public blockchains. Therefore, the updates only focused on the base modules will be committed to the "base" branch, while the economics and governance logics focused updates are committed to the "master" branch.

We will update more detailed guidelines to collaborate with community developers.
